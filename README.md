# Startup Digest Clipper Extension

The Startup Digest Clipper is a cross-browser extension that helps
curators import quality events into StartupDigest, so that curators
spend less time copy-pasting event data and more time building their
community.

2. Install Python 2.7 [download](http://www.python.org/download/)
3. Build the extension:

# LICENSE

We're using the kango library to make building our extension
cross-browser easier.  One of the stipulations of using Kango is that:

> Kango is free for open source non-profitable projects.

Since Startup Digest is a non-profit, this project claims that benefit.
