# Startup Digest Clipper Extension

The Startup Digest Clipper is a cross-browser extension that helps
curators import quality events into StartupDigest, so that curators
spend less time copy-pasting event data and more time building their
community.

# Getting Started

1) Clone this repository.
2) Install Python 2.7 ([download])(http://www.python.org/download/)

# LICENSE

We're using the kango library to make building our extension
cross-browser easier.  One of the stipulations of using Kango is that:

> Kango is free for open source non-profitable projects.

([source])(http://kangoextensions.com/kango.html)

Since Startup Digest is a non-profit, this project claims that benefit.
